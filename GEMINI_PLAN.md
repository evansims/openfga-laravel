# Gemini's Improvement Plan for openfga-laravel

This document outlines a strategic plan for enhancing the `openfga-laravel` package. The project is already of high quality, and these suggestions are intended to build upon its strong foundation.

---

## Prioritization

The plan is prioritized to deliver the most impactful changes first.

1.  **Developer Experience (DX):** Foundational improvements that make the package easier and more robust to use. This is the highest priority as it benefits all current and future users.
2.  **Feature Enhancements:** New capabilities that unlock significant use cases, such as migrating existing projects and enabling multi-tenancy.
3.  **Performance:** Advanced optimizations for high-throughput scenarios.
4.  **Documentation:** Enhancements to what is already very comprehensive documentation.

## 1. üõ†Ô∏è Developer Experience (DX)

### 1.1. Custom, Typed Exceptions ‚úÖ
**Benefit:** Allows developers to write clean, precise `try/catch` blocks for specific error conditions.

- [x] Create a base `OpenFgaException` class that extends `\Exception`.
- [x] Define specific exception classes (e.g., `ModelNotFoundException`, `InvalidTupleException`, `StoreNotFoundException`) in the `src/Exceptions` directory.
- [x] Wrap the underlying OpenFGA SDK exceptions in our custom exceptions within the `OpenFgaManager` and other relevant services.
- [x] Update method docblocks across the codebase to include `@throws` tags for the new exceptions.
- [ ] Add a section to the `troubleshooting.md` documentation explaining the common exceptions and how to handle them.

### 1.2. IDE Helper Integration ‚úÖ
**Benefit:** Massively improves developer productivity by enabling full autocompletion and static analysis within IDEs.

- [x] Add `barryvdh/laravel-ide-helper` to the `require-dev` section of `composer.json`.
- [x] Create a custom `IdeHelper` provider in the `src/Providers` directory.
- [x] Implement the provider to generate metadata for the `OpenFGA` facade.
- [x] Add instructions to the `installation.md` documentation on how developers can generate the helper file for their projects.

### 1.3. Architectural Testing with Pest ‚úÖ
**Benefit:** Prevents architectural drift and ensures code remains decoupled and maintainable.

- [x] Add `pest-plugin-arch` to the `require-dev` section of `composer.json`.
- [x] Create a new `tests/Architecture` test suite in `phpunit.xml`.
- [x] Create a new `tests/Architecture.php` test file.
- [x] Add an initial set of architectural rules, such as ensuring the use of strict types and enforcing that specific namespaces do not depend on others directly.
- [x] Document the architectural tests in the `testing.md` file.

## 2. üöÄ Feature Enhancements

### 2.1. Spatie `laravel-permission` Synchronization Command ‚úÖ
**Benefit:** Provides a clear migration path for existing applications using the Spatie permission library.

- [x] Create a new Artisan command, `openfga:sync-spatie-permissions`.
- [x] Implement the command logic to read roles, permissions, and user/role assignments from the database.
- [x] Use the `OpenFgaManager` to write the corresponding relationship tuples to OpenFGA.
- [x] Add robust error handling and user feedback to the command.
- [x] Add a dedicated page in the documentation for this command under the "Spatie Compatibility" section.
- [x] Add integration tests for the command.

### 2.2. Introduce OpenFGA Webhook Handling ‚úÖ
**Benefit:** Greatly improves data consistency for applications that require real-time authorization updates.

- [x] Create a new `WebhookController` in the `src/Http/Controllers` directory.
- [x] Define a new route in a `routes/webhooks.php` file that points to the controller.
- [x] Implement a `WebhookProcessor` service to handle the logic of parsing the webhook and invalidating the relevant cache entries.
- [x] Add a `webhook` section to the `config/openfga.php` file to enable/disable handling and configure the endpoint.
- [x] Add a new `webhooks.md` documentation file explaining the feature and setup.

### 2.3. First-Class Multi-Tenancy Support
**Benefit:** Allows a single Laravel instance to serve multiple tenants with isolated authorization.

- [ ] Update the `config/openfga.php` file to support a `connections` array, each with its own `store_id`, `api_token`, etc.
- [ ] Modify the `OpenFgaManager` to accept a `connection` name and return a client configured for that connection.
- [ ] Implement a `setConnection(string $name)` method on the manager to switch the default connection at runtime.
- [ ] Refactor existing services to resolve their OpenFGA client from the manager, respecting the selected connection.
- [ ] Add integration tests for switching between tenants.
- [ ] Update the documentation to explain the multi-tenancy configuration.

---

## 3. ‚ö° Performance

### 3.1. Integrate `WriteBehindCache` with Laravel Queues
**Benefit:** Increases the reliability of write operations and keeps web requests fast.

- [ ] Create a new `WriteTupleToFga` job class in the `src/Jobs` directory.
- [ ] Update the `WriteBehindCache` service to dispatch this job instead of writing directly to the API.
- [ ] Add a `queue` configuration option to `config/openfga.php` to specify the desired queue connection and tube.
- [ ] Ensure the job is serializable and handles potential failures gracefully (e.g., using retries).
- [ ] Document this feature in the `performance.md` and `cache/write-behind.md` files.

---

## 4. üìö Documentation

### 4.1. Add Visual Request Lifecycle Diagram
**Benefit:** Provides an immediate, intuitive understanding of how the package's components interact.

- [ ] Choose a Mermaid.js diagram type (e.g., flowchart).
- [ ] Create the diagram illustrating the flow from a `Gate::check()` call through the package's services to the OpenFGA API.
- [ ] Embed the diagram in the `quickstart.md` file.

### 4.2. Create a "Cookbook/Recipes" Section
**Benefit:** Helps users solve real-world problems with the library.

- [ ] Create a new `docs/cookbook` directory.
- [ ] Add an initial recipe for "Implementing RBAC".
- [ ] Add a second recipe for "Handling Organization/Team Permissions".
- [ ] Update the main documentation navigation to include the new "Cookbook" section.
